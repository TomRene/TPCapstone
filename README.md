# TPCapstone

## This is my capstone project

A particular stock chart pattern that I have witnessed in the past has intrigued me. I used to call it the parabolic acceleration pattern. Its characteristic configuration is defined by not only higher lows over a defined time period but lows that progressively go higher. The curve that fits underneath the lows in the establishing timeframe appears to be non- linear, i.e., a typical straight trendline does not fit but rather a form that is more  hyperbolic, exponential, non linear does.

I have witnessed this pattern many times and i have associated it with a stock or commodity 'breaking out' to the upside. But this evidence is anecdotal to my own point of view and I would like to validate it with real data over a broad spectrum. The question I would like to answer then is the following: Once this 'power' pattern is identified in the inital timeframe, how predictive of ensuing gains is it in a timeframe of equal magnitude to the set-up timeframe?

I will use data from Yahoo Finance.

I am very familiar with the stock market and its patterns. I worked in the markets several years ago and so I chose this subject area because of the familiarity I have with it, and my continuing interest in the domain.

I think that the scope is reasonable for a capstone for this class and I will learn the following while realising it:

	1- Fetch stock data from an API at scale using Python.

	2- Manipulate, munge and prepare the data for analysis using Pandas.

	3- Design elaborate Python code structures and algorithms to hunt, identify and earmark these
	patterns along a time series then build a simple trading rule for validation.

	4- Get my head into the math equations (power, exponential functions) that will be needed for
	mapping/identifying the patterns and any non-linear regressions needed.

There, that's it. I anticipate many challenges especially upfront in designing and testing the code to identify the pattern so I can work with it, also finding a general rule to map over varying stock price grid numbers into a generalized grid that be normalized for the curve fitting. It's one thing to identify the pattern, it's another to transcribe that pattern into a 'library' of applicable math formulas with an allowable range of expressions. I guess simpler the better but i will have plenty of data to dispel any overfitting errors I guess.
