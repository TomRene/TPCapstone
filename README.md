# TPCapstone

## This is my capstone project

	• What is the question you hope to answer?
	A particular stock chart pattern that I have witnessed in the past has intrigued me. I used to call it the parabolic acceleration pattern. Its characteristic configuration is defined by not only higher lows over a defined time period but lows that progressively go higher. The curve that fits underneath these lows in the time period appears non linear, i.e., a typical straight trendline does not fit but rather more a hyperbolic, exponential, non linear form does.
	I have witnessed this pattern many times and i have associated it with the stock or commodity 'breaking out' to the upside. The question I would like to answer is the following: Once this pattern is identified in the inital timeframe, is it predictive of ensuing gains in a timeframe of equal magnitude to the initial timeframe?
	
	• What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
	I will use data from Yahoo Finance.
	• What do you know about the data so far?
	I am very familiar with the stock market and its patterns. I worked in the markets several years ago.
	• Why did you choose this topic?
	I chose this topic because I have a lot of familiarity with the domain and it is of continuing interest to me.
	I think that the scope is reasonable for a capstone for this class and I will learn the following while realising it:
	- Fetch stock data from an API at scale.
	- Manipulate, munge and prepare the data for analysis.
	- Design elaborate Python code structures and algorithms to hunt, identify and earmark these patterns along a time series then build a simple trading rule for validation.
	- Get my head into the math equations (power, exponential functions) that will be needed for mapping/identifying the patterns and any non-linear regression needed

Characteristics of a good project question
	• Clearly defined: The question can easily be summarized in a single statement ("Can we predict A based on B?").
	• As simple as possible: The question has a narrow focus rather than broad goals.
	• Reasonably available data: The question depends on data that is likely to be available in a "meaningful" quantity.
Reasonable hypothesis: The question examines factors (B) that might actually be predictive of the outcome (A).
