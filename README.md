# TPCapstone

## This is my capstone project

A particular stock chart pattern that I have witnessed in the past has intrigued me. I used to call it the parabolic acceleration pattern. Its characteristic configuration is defined by not only higher lows over a defined time period but lows that progressively go higher. The curve that fits underneath these lows in the time period appears non linear, i.e., a typical straight trendline does not fit but rather more a hyperbolic, exponential, non linear form does.

I have witnessed this pattern many times and i have associated it with the stock or commodity 'breaking out' to the upside. The question I would like to answer is the following: Once this 'power' pattern is identified in the inital timeframe, is it predictive of ensuing gains in a timeframe of equal magnitude to the initial timeframe?

I will use data from Yahoo Finance.

I am very familiar with the stock market and its patterns. I worked in the markets several years ago.

I chose this topic because I have a lot of familiarity with the domain and it is of continuing interest to me.

I think that the scope is reasonable for a capstone for this class and I will learn the following while realising it:
	- Fetch stock data from an API at scale.
	- Manipulate, munge and prepare the data for analysis.
	- Design elaborate Python code structures and algorithms to hunt, identify and earmark these patterns along a time series then build a simple trading rule for validation.
	- Get my head into the math equations (power, exponential functions) that will be needed for mapping/identifying the patterns and any non-linear regression needed
